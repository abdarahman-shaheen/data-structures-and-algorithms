 ## 1. [Challenge1 (Array-reverse)](data-structures-and-algorithms/Code-Challenge-1/README.md)
  - Feature Tasks
  Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array 
  with elements in reversed order.

 ## 2. [Challenge2 (Array-insert-shift)](data-structures-and-algorithms/Code-Challenge-2/README.md)
  - Feature Tasks
  Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and a value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, 
  return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

 ## 3. [Challenge3 (Binary Search)](data-structures-and-algorithms/Code-Challenge-3/README.md)
 - Feature Tasks
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.
NOTE: The search algorithm used in your function should be a binary search.
