## Table of Contents
 ## 1. [Challenge1 (Array-reverse)](data-structures-and-algorithms/Code-Challenge-1/README.md)
  - Feature Tasks
  Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array 
  with elements in reversed order.

 ## 2. [Challenge2 (Array-insert-shift)](data-structures-and-algorithms/Code-Challenge-2/README.md)
  - Feature Tasks
  Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and a value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, 
  return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

 ## 3. [Challenge3 (Binary Search)](data-structures-and-algorithms/Code-Challenge-3/README.md)
 - Feature Tasks
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.
NOTE: The search algorithm used in your function should be a binary search.
Check the Resources section for details

## 4. [Challenge5 (Linked-List)](https://github.com/abdarahman-shaheen/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/master/data-structures-and-algorithms/Code-challenge-5/README.md)
- Features
Node
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
Linked List
Create a Linked List class
Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
The class should contain the following methods
insert
Arguments: value
Returns: nothing
Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
includes
Arguments: value
Returns: Boolean
Indicates whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
to string
Arguments: none
Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
## 5. [Challenge6 (Linked-List-Insertion)](https://github.com/abdarahman-shaheen/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/master/data-structures-and-algorithms/Code-challenge-6/README.md)
- Features
  Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

append
arguments: new value
adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
insert before
arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified
insert after
arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified

## 6. [Challenge7 (Linked-List-Search)](https://github.com/abdarahman-shaheen/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/master/data-structures-and-algorithms/Code-challenge-7/README.md)
- Features
-  Write the following method for the Linked List class:
kth from end
argument: a number, k, as a parameter.
Return the node’s value that is k places from the tail of the linked list.
You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.





## 7. [Challenge8 (Linked-List-Zip)](https://github.com/abdarahman-shaheen/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/master/data-structures-and-algorithms/Code-challenge-8/README.md)
- Features
 domain here is to implement a function called zipLists that takes two linked lists as arguments and returns a new linked list by zipping the two lists together. Zipping the lists means that the nodes from the two input lists will alternate in the resulting list.


## 8. [Challenge10 (Stack&&Queue)](https://github.com/abdarahman-shaheen/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/master/data-structures-and-algorithms/Code-challenge-10/README.md)
Features
Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue

## 9. [Challenge11 (PesudoQueue)](https://github.com/abdarahman-shaheen/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/master/data-structures-and-algorithms/Code-challenge-11/README.md)
- Feature
Create a new class called pseudo queue.
Do not use an existing Queue.
Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below),
Internally, utilize 2 Stack instances to create and manage the queue
Methods:
enqueue
Arguments: value
Inserts a value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
dequeue
Arguments: none
Extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.


## 9. [Challenge12 (stack-queue-animal-shelter)]()
- Feature
Feature Tasks
Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats.
The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
