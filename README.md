 ## 1. [Challenge1 (Array-reverse)](data-structures-and-algorithms/Code-Challenge-1/README.md)
  - Feature Tasks
  Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array 
  with elements in reversed order.

 ## 2. [Challenge2 (Array-insert-shift)](data-structures-and-algorithms/Code-Challenge-2/README.md)
  - Feature Tasks
  Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and a value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, 
  return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

 ## 3. [Challenge3 (Binary Search)](data-structures-and-algorithms/Code-Challenge-3/README.md)
 - Feature Tasks
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.
NOTE: The search algorithm used in your function should be a binary search.

## 4. [Challenge5 (Linked-List)](https://github.com/abdarahman-shaheen/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/master/data-structures-and-algorithms/Code-challenge-5/README.md)
- Features
Node
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
Linked List
Create a Linked List class
Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
The class should contain the following methods
insert
Arguments: value
Returns: nothing
Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
includes
Arguments: value
Returns: Boolean
Indicates whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
to string
Arguments: none
Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
