# Linked list

## Approach & Efficiency
**Algorithm**
- create two classes one to node and two is linked list .
- class node is include the value and pointer to
- next node  and previous node.
- class linked list is include all the node also head and tail.
- link between node with pointer .
- iteration kth from tail to previous node.
